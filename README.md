## Overview

**SwiftlyS2-Retakes** is a CS2 retakes game mode for **SwiftlyS2**.

It handles:

- **Round Flow** (automatic site selection, freeze time management, and round cleanup)
- **Automatic Bomb Planting** (bomb is automatically planted at freeze end at the selected site)
- **Instant Plant & Defuse** (instant plant support and smart instant defuse logic with molly/enemy checks)
- **Weapon Allocation** (dynamic weapon, armor, and utility distribution based on round type)
- **Weapon Preferences** (persistent menus for players to choose their preferred loadouts)
- **Map Configurations** (custom per-map JSON configs for spawns and smoke scenarios)
- **Spawn Editor** (comprehensive in-game tools for managing spawns and smokes)
- **Queue System** (supports max player limits, spectator queues, and late joiners)
- **Smoke Scenarios** (pre-defined smokes that can be forced or randomly spawned)
- **AFK Manager** (automatically moves inactive players to spectator or kicks them)
- **Anti Team-Flash** (blocks teammates from being blinded by friendly flashes)
- **Solo Bot System** (automatically spawns a bot to play against when only one human is present)
- **World Breaker** (automatically breaks glass and opens doors at round start for better flow)
- **Damage Reports** (detailed per-opponent damage summary at the end of each round)
- **Clutch Announcements** (notifies players of 1vX clutch situations)
- **Native Message Suppression** (suppresses redundant game messages for a cleaner chat experience)

## Dependencies

| Plugin | Required | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Cookies](https://github.com/SwiftlyS2-Plugins/Cookies) | **Yes** | Persistent player preferences (AWP toggle, weapon loadouts, spawn selections, etc.) |

> **Note:** Without the Cookies plugin installed and loaded, player preferences will **not** be saved between sessions — all settings will reset on disconnect.

## Installation

1. Download/build the plugin.
2. Install the **[Cookies](https://github.com/SwiftlyS2-Plugins/Cookies)** plugin (see Dependencies above).
3. Copy the published plugin folder to your server:

```
.../game/csgo/addons/swiftlys2/plugins/Retakes/
```

4. Ensure the plugin has its `resources/` folder alongside the DLL (maps, translations, gamedata).
5. Start/restart the server.

## Player Preferences & Persistence

The plugin saves **18 different player preferences** using the [Cookies](https://github.com/SwiftlyS2-Plugins/Cookies) plugin for persistent storage across sessions.

### What Gets Saved

All player preferences are automatically saved and persist between disconnects/reconnects:

#### Weapon Preferences
- **AWP Toggle** (`!awp`) — Whether the player wants to receive an AWP when available
- **SSG08 Toggle** — Whether the player wants to receive a Scout when available  
- **AWP Priority** — Whether the player gets priority in AWP allocation
- **Pistol Round Primary** — Preferred primary weapon for pistol rounds (per-team or shared)
- **Half-Buy Primary/Secondary** — Preferred weapons for half-buy rounds (per-team or shared)
- **Full-Buy Primary/Secondary** — Preferred weapons for full-buy rounds (per-team or shared)

#### Spawn Preferences
- **Spawn Menu Toggle** (`!spawns`) — Whether the CT spawn selection menu is enabled
- **T Spawn A/B** — Preferred spawn position for T side on each bombsite
- **CT Spawn A/B** — Preferred spawn position for CT side on each bombsite

### How It Works

1. **On Player Connect** — The Cookies plugin automatically loads all saved preferences from the database
2. **On Setting Change** — Any preference change (via `!guns`, `!awp`, `!spawns`, etc.) is immediately saved to Cookies
3. **Auto-Save** — Cookies flushes all changes to the database every 5 seconds
4. **On Disconnect** — All preferences are saved to the database before the player leaves

### Without Cookies Plugin

If the Cookies plugin is **not installed**, the plugin will still function but:
- ⚠️ All preferences reset to defaults when a player disconnects
- ⚠️ Settings like `!awp`, weapon loadouts, and spawn selections are **lost between sessions**
- ⚠️ Players must reconfigure their preferences every time they join

### Technical Details

- **Storage Keys**: All preferences use the `retakes_*` prefix (e.g., `retakes_wants_awp`, `retakes_ct_spawn_a`)
- **Data Types**: Booleans for toggles, integers for spawn IDs, strings for weapon names
- **Per-Team Settings**: Weapon preferences can be configured per-team (T/CT) or shared, based on `config.json` setting `retakes.preferences.usePerTeamPreferences`

## Weapon Allocation

The plugin automatically gives players weapons, armor, and grenades each round. The loadout depends on the **round type** and respects player preferences set via `!guns`.

### Round Types

| Round Type | Armor | Primary | Secondary | Grenades | CT Defuser |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pistol** | Kevlar (no helmet by default) | Pistols | ❌ | Flash or smoke | 1 random player |
| **Half-Buy** | Kevlar + Helmet | SMGs/Budget rifles | ✅ Pistol | Smoke + 1-2 more | Everyone |
| **Full-Buy** | Kevlar + Helmet | Rifles (or AWP/Scout) | ✅ Pistol | Smoke + 1-2 more | Everyone |

### How Round Types Are Selected

Set via `retakes.allocation.roundType` in config:

| Mode | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `"random"` **(default)** | Mix of all types based on percentages (20% pistol, 30% half, 50% full) |
| `"pistol"` or `"p"` | Pistol rounds only |
| `"half"` or `"h"` | Half-buy rounds only |
| `"full"` or `"f"` | Full-buy rounds only |
| `"sequence"` | Custom sequence (e.g., 3 pistol → 2 half → full forever) |

<details>
<summary><b>Sequence Mode Example</b></summary>

```json
{
  "retakes": {
    "allocation": {
      "roundType": "sequence",
      "roundTypeSequence": [
        { "Type": "Pistol", "Count": 3 },
        { "Type": "HalfBuy", "Count": 2 },
        { "Type": "FullBuy", "Count": 25 }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Plays 3 pistol rounds, then 2 half-buy, then full-buy for all remaining rounds.
</details>

### AWP & Scout Allocation

**Only on full-buy rounds.** Players must enable `!awp` or SSG08 in their preferences to be eligible.

#### AWP Settings
- **How many per team:** `awpPerTeam` (default: 1)
- **Low population mode:** If team has ≤ 4 players, there's only a 50% chance AWPs spawn
- **VIP priority:** Players with the `@css/vip` flag (configurable) can get priority AWP picks

#### Scout (SSG08) Settings
- **How many per team:** `ssg08PerTeam` (default: 0 = disabled)
- Players who get an AWP won't get a Scout

### Weapon Selection

- **Human players:** Get their preferred weapons from the `!guns` menu
- **Bots:** Get random weapons from the allowed list
- If a preference isn't available, a random weapon is chosen

### Grenades

| Round Type | Grenades Given |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pistol** | 1 flashbang OR 1 smoke (random) |
| **Half-Buy** | 1 smoke + 1 random (flash/HE/molly) |
| **Full-Buy** | 1 smoke + 1 random + 50% chance for a 2nd random |

### Common Settings

| Config | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `retakes.allocation.enabled` | `true` | Enable/disable weapon allocation |
| `retakes.allocation.stripWeapons` | `true` | Remove old weapons before giving new ones |
| `retakes.allocation.givePistolOnRifleRounds` | `true` | Give secondary pistol on half/full-buy rounds |
| `retakes.allocation.instantSwap` | `true` | Instantly swap weapons in-hand when a player changes preference mid-round via `!guns` or `!gun` |
| `retakes.allocation.pistolHelmet` | `false` | Give helmet (kevlar + helmet) on pistol rounds. When `false`, players only receive kevlar |
| `retakes.preferences.usePerTeamPreferences` | `false` | Separate T/CT weapon preferences in `!guns` menu |

## Configuration

The plugin uses SwiftlyS2's JSON config system.

- **File name**: `config.json`
- **Section**: `retakes`

On first run the config will be created automatically. The exact resolved path is logged on startup:

```
Retakes: config.json path: ...
```

Useful config fields (non-exhaustive):

- `retakes.server.freezeTimeSeconds`
- `retakes.server.chatPrefix`
- `retakes.server.chatPrefixColor`
- `retakes.queue.*`
- `retakes.teamBalance.*`
- `retakes.weapons.*`
- `retakes.preferences.usePerTeamPreferences` — Enable separate weapon preferences for T/CT

### Damage Report

| Config field | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `retakes.damageReport.enabled` | `true` | Enable/disable the per-opponent damage summary shown in chat at round end |

### Instant Defuse Messages

The instant defuse result messages can be targeted per-audience:

| Config field | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `retakes.instantBomb.successfulMessageTarget` | `"all"` | Who sees the "defused successfully" message |
| `retakes.instantBomb.unsuccessfulMessageTarget` | `"all"` | Who sees the "defuse failed" message |

**Accepted values** (must be a lowercase string):

| Value | Behaviour |
| :--- | :--- |
| `"all"` | Sent to every player on the server |
| `"team"` | Sent only to the CT team (the defusing side) |
| `"player"` | Sent only to the player who attempted the defuse |

```json
"instantBomb": {
  "successfulMessageTarget": "all",
  "unsuccessfulMessageTarget": "all"
}
```

## Map configs

Map configs live in:

```
plugins/Retakes/resources/maps/*.json
```

Each map file contains the spawns used by the retakes allocator.
